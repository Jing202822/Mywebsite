Welcome to My Portfolio
Let's use data for good together!


Hi! I am Jingyi Yang, a graduate student pursuing a Master of Science in Data Analytics and Computational Social Science at UMass Amherst. After earning a Bachelor's degree in Sociology and Psychology, I realized the importance of data in the daily life and had a passion for using data for good. In short, I am interested in using the various programing tools to analyze data and applying data analysis in the decision making.
