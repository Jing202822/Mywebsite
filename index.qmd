:::{#me}

Hi! I am Jingyi Yang, a graduate student pursuing a Master of Science in Data Analytics and Computational Social Science at UMass Amherst. After earning a Bachelor’s degree in Sociology, I realized the importance of data in daily life and had a passion for using data for good. In short, I am interested in using various programming tools to analyze data and apply data analysis to support decision-making.

To learn more about me, please visit my [CV](cv.qmd) and [Projects](projects.qmd) pages. Let’s use data for good together!
