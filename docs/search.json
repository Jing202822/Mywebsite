The survey data from Amazon Mechanical Turk include variables such as occupation, weather, and driving distance. It also covers demographic variables such as age, education level, and gender.\nMachine learning helps learning behavioral patterns from past data and provides predictions of coupon acceptance. This approach improves efficiency, reduces workload, and promotes strategies that can reduce expenses and increase revenue.\nLink to project"

    "text": "Executive Orders and Ideological Leaning Project\nThis study uses the executive order data set to develop an analysis of executive orders, with subsets of racial indicators, and create an ideological scale to identify different administrations’ positions through the dimension of race. The President signed executive orders to implement the policies and explain the priorities. Politics can be understood through the spatial mode (left and right are metaphors that relate to space in politics). The worldfish method can estimate policy space by using the provided text and without external information.\nLink to project"
